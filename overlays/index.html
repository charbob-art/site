        <p>Overlays is my genesis NFT project, a pre-generated collection available on <a href="https://objkt.com/collection/KT1Vv5V8EWVBnxoB2UmpSuDfRXwJaB4LEBcL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">objkt</a>. Written entirely in Python using the Python
            Imaging Library (PIL), it is quite versatile in the images that it can output. It uses a simple path-finding algorithm to draw two layers of lines, randomly omitting some. Other features affected by randomness are the line thickness, color
            palette, and line density.</p>

        <h3>process</h3>

        <p>As soon as I saw the variety and success of generative art in the NFT world, I knew I wanted to dive in. I had taken a course in college that was entirely based in processing, and I had dabbled in generative art without knowing that it was an
            established art medium. In early 2022, I was thinking about what my first NFT project would be, and I randomly found this old doodle I had done years earlier.</p>

        <img class="main" src="img/overlays-doodle.jpg">

        <p>I remember drawing this while half paying attention to something else. When I found it again, I realized that there were clear rules that I had established for myself while drawing it. For example, lines could only start on 1/2 segments of the
            grid, could not collide with eachother, and could only turn 90 degrees. There are probably many other more subtle rules too, but those are the ones that I payed most attention to.</p>

        <p>I started in python by establishing a grid system, and some lines made of rectangles going from point to point. The first versions started in the top left grid point, tried to draw a long line, then started from the next grid point. This method
            was kept all the way through the final iteration of the project. Below are some early explorations.</p>
        <div class="photo-row">
            <img class="qtr" src="img/overlays-inprogress01.png">

        </div>


        <p>As shown above, the algorithm was already pretty versatile, I could change the line stroke width, the grid density, and the margin, leading to some varied results that still felt cohesive together.</p>

        <p>Something I wanted from the start was for the final image to have some kind of texture. I wanted to avoid the pixel-perfect look that is so easy for generative art to have. I experimented with various built-in filters, as well as changing the
            line cap shape to a circle, creating rounded lines.</p>

        <p>At this point, I was drawing each line using a random color within certain bounds. This established a decent color palette, but it started looking like melted ice cream mush, so I </p>
